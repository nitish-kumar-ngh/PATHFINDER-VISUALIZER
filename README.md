# Pathfinder Visualization

## Overview
Pathfinder Visualization is a tool designed to visualize pathfinding algorithms in action. It provides an interactive interface to understand how algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, and others find paths in different scenarios.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization:** Watch as paths are calculated in real-time on a grid-based map.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Choose from various pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra's, A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), etc.
- **Customizable Grid:** Adjust grid size and obstacles to simulate different environments.
- **Source and Destination:** Set your starting and target positions to see how algorithms find the shortest path.
- **Step-by-Step Mode:** See each step of the algorithm's process with detailed explanations.

## Installation
To run Pathfinder Visualization locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nitish-kumar-ngh/PATHFINDER-VISUALIZER.git

2. **Navigate to the Project directory:**
   ```bash
  cd PATHFINDER-VISUALIZER

3. **Install dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed:**
   ```bash
  npm install
4. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
  npm start

5. **Access the application in your browser at 'http://localhost:3000/Pathfinder':**


## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **React:** Front-end library for building the user interface and components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Language used for the application logic and algorithm implementations.
- **CSS:** Styling the components and layout of the application.
- **HTML5 Canvas:** Utilized for rendering the maze grid and pathfinding visualization.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:**
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Finds the shortest path in an unweighted grid.
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path with non-negative weights.
  - **A* Search Algorithm:** Combines Dijkstra's algorithm with a heuristic to improve performance.
- **Randomized Prim's Algorithm:** Used for maze generation, creating complex environments for pathfinding algorithms to navigate.



The project structure and architecture are designed to provide a clear visualization of pathfinding algorithms in action, offering users an interactive and educational experience.
