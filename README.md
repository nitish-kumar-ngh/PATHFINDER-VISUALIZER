# Pathfinder Visualization

## Overview
Pathfinder Visualization is a tool designed to visualize pathfinding algorithms in action. It provides an interactive interface to understand how algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, and others find paths in different scenarios.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization:** Watch as paths are calculated in real-time on a grid-based map.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Choose from various pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra's, A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), etc.
- **Customizable Grid:** Adjust grid size and obstacles to simulate different environments.
- **Start and End Points:** Set your starting and target positions to see how algorithms find the shortest path.
- **Step-by-Step Mode:** See each step of the algorithm's process with detailed explanations.

## Installation
To run Pathfinder Visualization locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathfinder-visualization.git
